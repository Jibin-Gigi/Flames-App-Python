# FLAMES App - The Future Predictor of Romance 

Welcome to the FLAMES App, where we take your love life as seriously as a cat chasing a laser pointer. This state-of-the-art, highly sophisticated, and predict your future relationship with your crush using ancient algorithms that mystics probably used (but we can't confirm).

## Features

- **Futuristic Love Analysis**: Uses cutting-edge technology (a.k.a. the FLAMES algorithm) to predict your romantic future.
- **Highly Accurate**: As accurate as a weather forecast. You know, it might rain, it might not.
- **Streamlit Integration**: Because everything looks cooler on the web, even your potential heartbreak.

## Installation

To get this crystal ball running on your machine, follow these steps:

```bash
pip install streamlit
git clone https://github.com/Jibin-Gigi/Flames-App-Python.git
cd Flames-App-Python
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage
Just type in your name and your crush’s name, and let the magic happen. It’s like a fortune cookie, but less crunchy and more digital.

# Humor Disclaimer
This app is meant for fun and should not be taken as a serious indication of your romantic future. If it predicts ‘Enemy’ and you end up getting married, we take full credit for the plot twist.
